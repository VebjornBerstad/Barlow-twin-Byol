# Barlow-twins-BYOL

This is a student project that aims to implement neural networks using self-supervised learning on audio data. We intend to generate general-purpose representations for downstream tasks. Out inspiration for the project is the [BYOL-A project](https://github.com/nttcslab/byol-a).
